# Configuring an App

Configuring your app begins in the "dna.JSON" or "dna.toml" file depending on if you are coding in AssemblyScript or rust. Think of the DNA files of your Holochain app as the developer specified configuration. Much like how DNA is the biological configuration or code of all organisms, which sets things like height, mental capacity, etc., the DNA of the Holochain app specifies things such as files that make the apps work (referred to as chromosomes or "Zomes" for short). Inside the 'Zomes' array (inside the conveniently named ".DNA" file, the developer specifies functions that he or she must implement. Additionally, all apps must implement functions specific to Holochain. Before moving onto developing your holochain app, I reccomend looking over these functions and keywords found at this link: https://developer.holochain.org/API.
